Fastline Corp will be a desktop-only platform. The user interface will be built using JavaFX. The user will first be greeted with a logon page, which asks for a username and password.

The user, if they provided the right credentials, will then be able to view the main application. The main application will be composed of a main stage, with an interchangeable center pane, which is where the user will perform all tasks. The top pane will have a menu bar that the user will use to navigate to the multiple center panes.
